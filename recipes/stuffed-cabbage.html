<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    My grandmother made this for my Dad and
    and my Mom made this regularly for everyone. 
</p>
<p>
    This was never my favorite, so I don't have the recipe. Going from (rough) memory here.
    I distinctly remember the smell of these cooking, though.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>cabbage</li>
    <li>ground beef</li>
    <li>rice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mix rice and beef</li>
    <li>make balls from the mix, and wrap them in cabbage leaves. 
        I think you have to tie them up with string.</li>
    <li>Put the wrapped balls in the oven, and bake for a while.</li>
    <li>cook until the house smells like cabbage</li>
    <li>Try to get someone to eat these. Good luck!</li>
</ol>
